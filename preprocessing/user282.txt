I m sorry but after reading that Ched seemed to have an intention to go into that hotel room he lied about his reasons for needing a key
But ultimately the question is should consent given when intoxicated be seen as being reliable
Accountability is important anyway we will never know if Ched is really guilty or not
Very important to note the receptionist stated some footballers booked the hotel room The stigma attached to being a public figure
May have been the deciding factor for Ched As far as the law is concerned he should know better
But is that fair Shouldn t we hold every single person to the same level of expectation
Public figure or not when it comes to the law right or wrong there shouldn t be a greater desire to punish 1 over the other
A man s livelihood is in jeopardy now because his job is to score goals and entertain
