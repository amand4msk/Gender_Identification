Wood Stick Great Minds
AL MISSELIJK
Sometimes it s best not to care
Me myself and I
What goes around comes back around
All the bullshit made me strong
old enough to know better young enough not to give a fuck
How can you understand something that you never had
Refresh your mind clear all your problems and just have fun with life
Don t bring bad energy around me
Np B Brave Ft Cho Waddup
RT Don t think i could forgive you

We make love and then we fuck and then you give me my space
Stay real stay loyal or stay the fuck away from me

TrueStory

When I get a text from you I immediately stop whatever I was doing to read it
A real king always has his queen s back
I miss what we almost had

I am stuck in a generation where love is just a quote
He is so cute damn
A middle finger emoji would be perfect
Not even a million fights could make me hate you

It s not love but it s pretty close
Every other day s a different game that you just can t win
Put it down on me just put it down on me down down on me
I need a soldier that ain t scared to stand up for me Known to carry big things if you know what I mean
Now that you re out of my life I m so much better
You thought that I d be weak without you but I m stronger
You thought that I d be broke without you but I m richer
You thought that I d be sad without you I laugh harder

You thought that I would die without you but I m livin

RT Sometimes what we want isn t what s best for us
You need a real woman in your life
There was a time I thought that you did everything right No lies no wrong boy I must ve been outta my mind
When I think of the time that I almost loved you you showed your ass and I saw the real you
You don t deserve my tears I guess that s why they ain t there
We ain t picture perfect but we worth the picture still
Love yourself girl or nobody will
Her mind is on a different level
She fuck she suck she swallow man it s like a triple double
