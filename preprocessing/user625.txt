Leaving my GA with the instructions to guard worktweet

Got offered the bar back position here at the cinema
Been at this job about 4 months and I got offered the job that most people are gunning for just by minding my own
Tbh I got nominated for this job being that at least 2 bartenders requested me by name when asked who they might want
Late night solo rips
