I obviously suck at tweeting
I m not staying home tonight
I literally hate you
I wish would stop putting addicting games on my phone
I just can t stop playing them
hahaha seriously though It s badddd
I know it just pisses me off when I lose
Well now that my games are canceled I need plans
no I hate you
cool Then the feelings mutual
just thought id remind you
you re right I am
I want to go to another mile stud concert
shut up Dana God
I know I fucked it up okay
give Dana the unfollow not me
I know
She s a good girl with a bad past
Practice what you preach
You re all drama Maybe it s time to grow up
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia and forget about the stupid little things
I have such a bad shopping addiction
Keep my circle small and a few that really get me
I could lay around in my robe for days
I ll have them like oy vey holy cow oh my god wow
I ll never understand how some people just don t play sports like what do you do with all of your free time
Should probably get my shit together but not tonight
You got it you got it bad
Jam session
I want to dance
Andddd everyone left me alone to think
It s hard to remember the last time I was actually happy
All I want is to party with
I fit in way better with the class that graduated last year so whyyyyyy couldn t I have been two years older
It gonna be a movie baby
Take me down take me all the way tonight soon I ll be leaving
I bought black jeggings so that when i get yelled at for wearing them I can tell them to fuck off
Charlotte Russe They are really comfortable too
that would just be ridiculous
exactly
I do what a want and anything you say or do won t stop me
If people would just mind their own business and worry about themselves instead of others they would have a lot less problems
So excited to have a foreign exchange student play volleyball
she s a little taller than Emily
haha that s a lot to expect
I ll try
she is I met her today I m so excited
If you ain t with it then we don t really need you it s whatever
thanks I know
Every song sounds better when mike stud sings it
Jam sessions are always my favorite
Don t lose your happiness on the pursuit for more
This mute button is the best
you won t see them on your tl but you ll still get notifications if they fav your tweet and they don t know you muted them
do you know if they are a girl or boy And what grade
oh cool
that was me
I ve got your back Jana
come back
whattttt
I m at a fire
sorry
Whyyyyy does Collin keep showing me his ass
Wish volleyball was later in the day so I could actually do things late at night
What do you call the toilet Bathroom oh Even though you don t take a bath
MISS YOU TOO BABE
You are beyond crazy
You re the worst kind of person
What the fuck is wrong with people
Tonight has been crazy to say the least
love you babe can t wait to see you tomorrow
I m just past the point of being tired
Running on 3 hours of sleep
Waiting in line to buy these tickets sucks
I don t have a card and my mom won t buy me one with hers
haha it s okay And not really there are like 60 people in front of us and like 50 behind us
Jason Aldean tickets
I ve got all my friends coming through and you should bring your friends too it s gonna be a movie
This day is forever long
I hate you john
tell me about it
everything you say is false
what time
Tonight was actually really fun
I m still running on 4 hours of sleep and I m not tired at all
That fire ball whiskey whispers temptation in my ear
I can t wait to go to college
I ll pack you sand to come with me
Someone text me
I have so much to do today but I don t want to get out of bed
really need to catch up on some sleep after these past couple of nights
it s not that I didn t want to I just can t because of volleyball camp tomorrow
you know it
I m sorry
Someone text me
wish you were coming babe
The best advice ever
The day I first met you you told me that you d never fall in love
I only get sugar high and polar pop wasted
I can hear emily singing in the shower
