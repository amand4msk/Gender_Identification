Started at the bottom but I m coming up like a beast
I missed my intended early bus so I hit the bong instead
Ughhhh my luck
Haven t even gotten to work and I desperately need a shower and to wash my clothes already if that says anything about my day so far
The good thing about having luck like mine is its helped make my outlook this
It s a bummer for the first 30 seconds then there s not much point in anything but laughing it off and planning the next step
Nice karmic turn around though with a free bus ride
The stench of Red Bull
Dozed on the mat for a good 15 minutes
Living down the block from the high school means I get to listen to the marching band start fucking up bright and early
