I should probably go to bed considering I have to be up at seven
I m such a sarcastic asshole I love it
So tired
Charleston bound
Ya you can find us where the party s at
I ve never been there I m excited to go
Laying on the beach is one of my favorite things to do
When I get back to Erie someone needs to be my workout buddy
People come and go that s just how life is
Feeling unwanted is the worst thing ever
I m actually crying because I m laughing so hard
still waiting
I know
I like the a s
Happy Birthday
Shes a little scared to get close to anyone because everyone that said ill always be here for you left
I would love to live in South Carolina
I m really not a big fan of cake or ice cream
The sun burn I got today has already turned to a tan
I kind of miss and
I know We have to do something soon
we leave Friday
I love buying things for people
Want me to air drop them to you niggy
yay Miss you so much
We re laughing all the way to the river bank
I will be tonight
Hey we might look a little crazy tonight but hey baby that s alright it s our back woods boondocks roots
Ya were proud to be young we stick to our guns we love who we love and we wanna have fun
If you re looking for someone make it someone else when you re drunk and it s late and you re missing me like hell keep it to yourself
Come on he ain t worth the pain do what you gotta do to forget his name
So go I ll be fine on my own
I just want to be back in Erie
Am I better off dead am I better off a quitter
So excited I m going to a fire tonight
I just want it all
Reminds me of and miss my girls
Headphones in world out
I hate having anxiety
I can t do this car ride anymore
You wanna be starting something you got to be starting something
story of my life
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK WHY IS THERE MORE TRAFFIC
Impatiently waiting for to put the parasailing pictures up
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday

You find out who your friends are
My family is completely plastered
I m about to drop all of my AP classes because fuck summer work
People are so fake nowadays
Stressed to the max
What s shoved up mine and parents asses today crazy
Never try to take 2 ap classes Ever
lang and psychology I m about to drop lang I think because I can t do it
ya is chem a lot of work
wow That s nothing at all
ya that s true There s a ton of work for lang Psyc isn t bad
there s chapters in the book you have to read Then you have to do the assignments in the book plus the things on moodle
If it weren t for I d never have games on my phone soaddicted
You know if my dog was as ugly as you I d shave his butt and tell him to walk backwards
I think should talk to batters like Porter does
Benny Rodriguez was one of my first crushes
It s so pink outside
To go for a run before practice orrrrrrr
No one will ever understand the way I think
Really glad I got to hangout with last night

I hate you

I wanna do something tonight
This is looking like a contest of who can act like they care less
Why do I feel like I m a second choice to everyone
Oh you don t like the way I live my life Well that s to fucking bad
Happiness is a choice So if you chose to be miserable all of the time I don t feel bad for you at all
If you re out of high school and you still have pity drama in your life I honestly feel bad for you
My life
you re welcome for making you listen to that song
and I are actually laughing at carrot jokes right now
The fact that Claire won t text me back
is a bitch

we re not related anymore
no that s not allowed either
Well this is embarrassing
we can all hope
Well tonight took a turn for the worst

I don t understand how you can just do these things knowing you re tearing your family apart
