Looking for my paralel line
AND EVEN IF THEY TRYYYYYYYYY
THEY LL NEVER TAKE MY BODY FROM YOUR SIDEEE
I wish I was not how I am
not in my casa
Stop pretending life doesn t terrify you
Don t grow up IT S A TRAP
I might not be the same but that s not important
And I can t change even if I try
It s impossible to find someone who will never hurt you so go for the one who s always worth all the pain
CUANDO TE MIRO Y NO ME MIRAS
Prove they re wrong
D NDE TENGO METIDA LA CABEZAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Wise men talk because they have something to say Fools talk because they have to say something
We keep lying ourselves so we can feel alive
mis apuntes son muy top
Kingdom of ice olation

BBK Live Festival I m on my way
Still looking for the light that wakes me up
A boy so pretty with an ugly heart
Pato I am this close to falling in love with you but im not gonna do that to myself if you re not ready And I dont think you re ready
NOCHE DE FLEXOOOOOO

Life is a beautiful sport
The inevitable tradeoff between what is physically realistic and what is mathematically possible
Sometimes all you need is someone who cares
You are like the top of a mountain The highest risk but the highest reward
When everything arounds me goes wrong it is maybe because im what s wrong
Sometimes people are beautiful Not in looks Not in what they say Just in what they are
You know that place between sleep and awake the place where you can still remember dreaming That s where I ll always love you
That s where I ll always be waiting Peter Pan J M Barrie
This is a nice day to be a birthday

Guiri esa worldwide known palabra

Sometimes the most obvious things are the most difficult to be said
Those pieces of you that you had to leave behind
You Ludus while I gape
The Spotlight Effect
er what
Your mind tells you what s smart and your heart tells you what you are going to do anyways
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting the results to change
You have to be the change you want to see in the world
At the gym i m like a ninja You ll never see me there
This room is hot but we could make it hotter with your help
Gente con gatos BASTA YA DE MANDAR FOTOS POR WHATSAPP CON ESOS SERES TAN ACHUCHABLES Besis
Sometimes tears are a sign of unspoken happiness and a smile is a sign of silent pain
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same but that s not important
As if nothing had happened I suppose
I cant stand to hear the silence of a busy train where no one wants to talk for the fear of looking insane
today design is LoL related Cute poros for everyone
Pues Finlandia se lleva muchos thumbs up
In every breath I take I m breathing you
Experience is what you get when you dont get what you wanted
And we ll pretend that the world will never end

Moving everydayyy going further on
The nights are long but the stars are brighter

Stuck on you
And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music Friedrich Nietzsche
Hold me closer hold me tighter
