@username *has spent the past 7 minutes trying to figure out what 'apper' means*


@username yes Ben games studies invented fun


@username @username @username followed by "who knew?"


Oh dear, I think Ramon Lobato may have just suggested game studies is part of media studies #good #shitfightbut #cciws13


Which is totally unfair because game studies invented play, materiality, bodies, and texts.


Anonymity as agency - @username unpacking some unrecognised assumptions re identity & 'privacy' & names & bodies #cciws13

@username well at least you've got the accent


I'm so impressed by the robust and generous intellectual engagement of everyone at #cciws13. I don't know how we magicked it up.


Um what exactly is the event that is happening in American democracy right now, mostly non-verbals in my stream
