Things I want for my business cards but are too expensive: 3 PMS colors. colored edges, soft touch finish, raised spot UV, cut 45°corners.


"painters produced their most highly valued work when they were 41.92 years old" http://t.co/T8Gvom70GE So... I've 15 years left for mine?


@username your new discussion layout is confusing regarding who says what, because the comments aren't sectioned off. http://t.co/Dfkg4js2o2


I never really understood why game environments (which you see most of) get so few resources compared to characters. https://t.co/3Af3fn7XVe


@username 20k and 2048² on a gun, fine. But throwing the same on an enemy that you try to shoot before he gets too close?


@username Guns using the texture already in memory is good. Guns on the floor having the same model as FPS isn't. Probably LOD models.


@username I'm talking about chars that are small scale compared to enviro props. Extreme example: http://t.co/HOR8W8T2Pr 30~40tri scene


@username Dammit Crendor. You broke Jesse's game and made the audio go *poof*. Totally your fault.


@username @username I liken Esther to a movie. You can choose to progress or not, but not affect much else. But really, grey area.


Gamers unfazed, Sale has arrived! The tiniest prices, finest of prizes. Gaben be Praised, Discounts shall thrive! http://t.co/tVbSgnvo1e


Indie gamedev: I don't want to be bound by publishers and marketing-tests. Indy gamedev: Games are an artform! They belong in a museum!


@username @username @username 25 mbit here (get 22~23), for €10 in the Netherlands. Previous contract since '08 or '09 was €25, same speed.


@username On the flipside: half games for half prices...


Happy new years with an appropriately times new site!


Just played the first two episodes of Quake again, game's still tight. Loving the smooth movement.


So apparently paying €5 a month for Spotify makes me worse than a music pirate...? Dafuq? http://t.co/eP8m6V18Om


@username Wanted to say I appreciate the choice for minions. Should make the game feel nicely crowded, and give 'bad' players more fun.


@username Heh. I think it's funny you're apologizing for sound quality that's still better than, say, 90% of youtube game voiceovers.


I know this is cool and serious science, but it had me giggling like a kid. Best of both worlds! http://t.co/MqlzTQRJ5H


Working on refining my logo... To chamfer or nor to chamfer, that is the question. http://t.co/QfOAeb6KA6


30c3 To Protect And Infect - YouTube http://t.co/tBS0nGZIXS I don't know a whole lot about network security, but enough that this scares me.


Silly Spotify. White Zombie, Judge Dredd (2012) Soundtrack, Rob Zombie, ...Blue Man Group? Okay then.


@username Thanks for mentioning the Hearthstone open beta! I've been anxiously waiting but hadn't gotten any emails about it yet.


@username Do you perchance read Jezebel? The timing is rather close: http://t.co/cUkl2hJM0j


@username I am so sick of people on twitter complaining about a bunch people on twitter!


"Helps to have a map!" No. No it doesn't. http://t.co/zFfXa1JfN9


@username Remember the time you paid 10 grand for "Celebrity fashion without airbrushing" pics? So do these people: http://t.co/iDvYn5FY2p


Steam's down. Wonder if that's because of the new music stuff?


Play this. Now, tomorrow, during lunch, whenever. It's only 5 minutes, but it's awesome: http://t.co/LCJKWXXAWy


First time I bought a key for DOTA2 treasure chest: Baby Roshan. Pretty sweet deal.


Hah! That shit's golden, Telltale! http://t.co/Bs3VwRCRzd


@username Are you still looking for people? I can free up some time and be (almost) completely dedicated the next month(s).


@username I threw up some isometric examples at https://t.co/eBHrIdFtBJ (assuming you want to stick with the RPGmaker perspective)


@username Not many developers/companies would opt out of lots of money because something's addictive. I respect you for that.


Now that's a proper free to play Dungeon Keeper!


http://t.co/Am1vJnMrjr I like this.


@username @username How do they not help? I find it very useful to know if a game has been designed for touchscreen, controller or KBM.


@username Remember that fake Twitch-LoL video from this afternoon? Here's a REAL Twitch-Plays-Dota channel: http://t.co/LQdUtiWq2x


@username Thanks for reminding me/us to disable adblock for places I regularly visit. Because it's often a fairer trade that TV/radio.


Mini Metro http://t.co/XYeHJ47bGm Quite a novel idea: build your own growing metro system. Not sure about longevity/replayability, though.


@username How about keeping the same root word and call them BullVids?


@username Coil, because of its several experiments. Mirror's Edge, because of its absence. And whichever game started radial menus. Crysis?


@username Consider that a free game thrown in by the gods, for your generous purchases.


@username "Luft" means air, not red. And "rauser" probably stems from the Dutch verb "rouzen", playing wildly or "razen", rage/storm.


@username Did you guys just change all your youtube video thumbnails or have I not paid proper attention lately?


@username @username Do you also know about https://t.co/6SYVXc4GfN ?


@username Is this april fools or did they really start a website on April 1st with the plan of confusing people on -every- anniversary?


Whelp. @username wanted drama. He got drama. Can the devs get a nice game jam now, since that's what they wanted? #GAME_JAM


Great april fools joke! Anita Sarkeesian receiving "GDC Ambassador award" for making 5 videos in two years' time. http://t.co/Wjl343UZLU


@username For a moment I thought I was reading about a game from @username


@username Your avvy is now black/red/white. Does this mean future content will be in Betrayer-vision?


@username Hey I wanted to inform you that Potato Dungeon seems to be borked right now. Clicking to ride Pard doesn't work. For me anyways.


Not fond of new @username design. Discrover shows less per page, and the menu bar shows less lines so I must scroll to get to my playlists.


@username @username It's a carefully planned deal. He asked both for the exact same amount, so he's raking in cash but staying neutral.


Combine any random music term in youtube, it probably has it. Raprock. Acapella metal. Industrial Jazz. Celtic chiptunes. Gregorian dubstep.


@username I feel like I can 'express myself' less right now. It's all white. Will there be a way to change style besides just link color??


@username @username Harold and Kumar walk Down the Aisle. Because racial inclusivity, of course. ;)


Just crashed in to more bugs in 45 minutes on the bike, than in the past two weeks of game development.


Goddamnit I hate it when a commenting system forces you to first register, but meanwhile doesn't save your typed post. @username #lookingatu


@username is the new UI broken or just badly designed? I can no longer sort albums or search queries by name/artist/album/length/rating...


@username @username Yes. But only cool people.


Might be cool for portfolios: @username: Horizontal scrolling single page template (also on Github): http://t.co/hCc5D07nze  #html5 #css3


@username I wonder how many people realized what horrible things they sometimes say. Good luck, best wishes, and dump that lump!


Just rode past some kids biking ~25 km for some @username . I guess that's pretty healthy in the end?


@username If you sit like this and stare past your crotch, it probably is. But only barely .http://t.co/rHhCiJSBcH


@username Here's hoping this will wake people up a bit about greenlight / early access / kickstarter, right?


@username What you're saying is, you're now opening a P.O. box under the name of CynicalCox?


@username You hypocrite, you. Closing down your P.O. box for other companies but still accepting bribes from Polaris! Bias. BIAS!!


Yay mustasch! http://t.co/D0ZqTeL8z7


@username @username Jim is, in fact, a Drag King. In real life he is an ethereal spirit, but for his shows he dresses up as a man.


@username The point is not better because 'harder' but 'balanced against lame exploits'; it means you actually think/engage with the game.


This should be enough energydrink for at LEAST two days... http://t.co/vQVmlkjcot


Bad pixel shirts are one of those things that annoy and bother me more than they probably should... http://t.co/b6fC4bNsUA


@username So what do we call this kind of review score? Hate.strife out of ten?


@username @username http://t.co/nbAGARjCmg Good Old Gaming, a store kinda like Steam, Origin, but aimed at retro/indie more than AAA.


@username U.S. healthcare; it'll cost you an arm and a leg either way...


@username Get the spambots under control, please. http://t.co/jLab9xuvp0 http://t.co/Yel8VPY1mn http://t.co/cenhgIaW3c http://t.co/k1CFBUjxDk


@username and here's yet another one: http://t.co/9NoCYffgCR


@username More spammers. Clean them up. http://t.co/VtTHVTUk00 http://t.co/uVfXbD7lNj


@username No, but I can reccommend you a great shirt: https://t.co/nlkzlrZEnY


Turns out, you should not attempt to run 4 km barefoot when you haven't done so in three years. Ouch.


@username @username Whoa whoa whoa. Not JUST a black baseball cap, one with a VERY iconic stitchy liny logo thing! http://t.co/sKMmh2gi4z


@username @username Half-life? No, no. Carmack made Doom, Quake, Rage. Half-life is from @username.


@username @username WHY? IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM? ARE THE ADS TOO SILENT TO HEAR FOR YOU? WE ARE NOT HAVING THAT ISSUE.


Going to try and get something done for #lowrezjam 2014. 5 days left so it's gonna be tight. But I know what I'm gonna make: a 16x9 fighter.


@username I'm not seeing the problem with that #lowrezjam workfile. Looks perfectly usable. http://t.co/Pv9PpWSKRw


@username As long as everything is in nice sprite strips I'm happy. For small stuff like this panning around is easier than tabs/windows.


@username Face pulp, actually. I should probably have scaled up the image 200% =P. Heck I'm working small enough to make the game 200%


@username @username I'd like to know which devs you consider upstanding/trustworthy what with Nintendo greed, Watchdog graphics and 1/2


@username @username indies such as Towns and that recent plane game (air control?). Who do you like, still? 2/2


I just spent an absurd amount of time playing with this remarkable online SID keyboard emulator: http://t.co/3udwseNUOk


@username While your point is true, you're not the best advocate. Lots of women feature their looks. #NotAllWomen http://t.co/rimrZzEAfJ


The times when your dog wants to eat the rotting half-corpse of a mouse and you have to pluck it out of her mouth... http://t.co/B6UO3JwjSK


@username Hey I wanted to check if you were aware of this Pixel Pig game using your artwork. http://t.co/nD2EBUCqCH


@username Good vid, but missing one element; presentation. Host as much content as possible, have curated lists of 'the best', 'the new' 1/2


@username 'the interesting' and so on. Make it easier to navigate, empowering critics/users. Not curation, but promotion/navigation. (2/2)


@username Wow, this was great. I love simple games like these that require very little time/complexity to convey a strong idea.


@username Oh no! http://t.co/WEENVxgVcv is offline, as are the forums. Sound the alarms! SOUND THE ALARMS!


@username @username the concentric pattern makes me wonder if dithering could make the layer transition more natural looking.


@username With facebook in your future, does this mean we might finally get a legitimate desktop version of WhatsApp?
