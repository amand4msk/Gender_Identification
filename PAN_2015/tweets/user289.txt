hi im brendan and i love lauren and phoebe soooo much


Is it just me or are One Direction a bit overrated by fans ?


I really need to get a life and stop binge-watching #BreakingBad :P


@username aha;3 So how's your knee then...?:|


@username ooh. Ouch. Feel sorry for you it must be a great early birthday present ;)


So I spent 45 minutes of my time this morning watching people trying to get a fly out of a lab #BreakingBad


Tomorrow is Monday and this is how I'm feeling right now...http://t.co/bXIIOJSt8M


My biggest fear at this moment in time is the #GrammarPolice. Who knows what I might spell wong next?


I liked a @username video from @username http://t.co/UI2rmxZC6J THE TOMORROW PEOPLE - GAG REEL


@username Thanks for my birthday present and card. :)


Think #BGT just showed that age is just a number and that you should never judge a book by its cover ...


Oxymandias. #BreakingBad . What.The.Hell...


#TheAmazingSpiderMan2 amazed me when I saw it earlier today. Highly recommendable as long as you've seen the previous film :)


This is going to horrify me for quite some time #Eastenders http://t.co/MAALQVp8y5

To be honest after those Uruguay and Spain games god knows what could happen in this match... #WorldCup2014


God this is tense #ENGvsITA #WorldCup2014

@username an equal match ,they both had great chances and it's a shame that no goals have been scored yet. Could be an exciting 2nd half ????????

@username ooooh , not long to wait now ???? ????????


@username wow, time to order a Germany shirt then ????


@username for me that is ????????????


@username it could be worse , you could be not going through (for the moment anyway????) just feel sorry for England and Spain ???? ????????


@username I'm routing for you to win there! #TeamUSA ????????????


@username Kind of routing for #TeamUSA in the last 2 minutes of this match as well , would be a great comeback ????????????


@username so close ???? Well done in getting through to the last 16! ????


@username thank you very much ????????????????????????


Bollocks “@username: Adam Lallana 'humbled' to join @username after £25m from @username http://t.co/y0l8RhrFI2”

I've spent my whole morning looking at 'Broom Broom' vines and now I feel like my life has no real purpose...


Right now I'm feeling the aftermath of having a Netflix binge last night... ????


The blue button on snapchat is basically suicide because if you were on the toilet when somebody pressed it , you would be seriously screwed


I'm officially in love with @username 's Cloudy Lemonade ????
