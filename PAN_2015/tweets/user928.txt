We be all night.


I just want to ease your mind and make everything all right. So go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight.


@username - Jhene Aiko Ft. Childish Gambino - Bed Peace.


Gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it. Ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted.


It's not love, but it's pretty close.


Every other day's a different game that you just can't win.


Put it down on me, just put it down on me, down down on me.


I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me. Known to carry big things, if you know what I mean.


Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better.


You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger.


You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer.


You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder.


You thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser.


Though that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter.


You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'.


I'm a survivor I'm gonna make it I will survive Keep on survivin'


You thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'.


RT @username: @username loool < hater


"@username: SOME TEACHERS REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS http://t.co/h3yD8Xj5UX"


I'm wishing you the best. Pray that you are blessed.


After of all of the darkness and sadness soon comes happiness.


You thought I couldn't see without you, perfect vision.


I'm getting closer to the edge and I'm about to fall, 'cause of you I don't remember who I am.


RT @username: Sometimes, what we want isn't what's best for us....


You need a real woman in your life.


There was a time, I thought, that you did everything right.. No lies, no wrong, boy, I must’ve been outta my mind.


When I think of the time that I almost loved you, you showed your ass and I saw the real you.


You don’t deserve my tears, I guess that’s why they ain’t there.


We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still.


Love yourself girl, or nobody will.


Her mind is on a different level.


She fuck, she suck, she swallow man, it's like a triple double.


Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble.


Just because they fuck ya, girl, don't mean them niggas love ya.


Mama couldn't never reach her. Brother tried his best to teach her.


She thinks she's ready for the world, just look at daddy's little girl.
