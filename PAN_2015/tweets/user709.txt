Wow. This is a really REALLY cool Wheatley. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzG94ct2d5k


@username Do you still model props/build levels for your current games or is it purely designing and delegating?


RT @username: 'DRM scheme that ENCOURAGES piracy is insane.'


@username No, dear god, no. You should buy something like this instead. It's even red&black! http://t.co/Z1k7OsH


This is cute and stuff. http://t.co/vnhHczd


Seems my Lowpoly Contest is quite a success. I wonder how many more people enter during this weekend... http://t.co/t1tkL6X


@username http://t.co/tNCOEzeZ More like Designer From Hell... Semi-bold is a perfectly valid request: http://t.co/EKQ8pd7V


It looks like... LG has finally pushed an upgrade for my phone!?¡¿ No more Android Cupcake 1.5!


Yesssss. Yes yes yes. It's now running froyo 2.2.2.


If I ever turn out to be absurdely rich, I'm going to buy a Clenet. http://t.co/eb5CLrko


No offense, but [insert offensive words here]


@username: any specific reason there's so much whitespace? You can easily have the wings twice as big as they are now, if you optimize the UV.


So... I just realized that the 2 series I like most are House, and Castle. Fun coinkidink.


RT @username: "Our TF2 art thread has nearly 4 THOUSAND more replies than the WAYWO threa." But it's also over twice as old... ;)


This short movie is brilliant! Everyone who does 3D art will love it: http://t.co/LHPpClKD


This makes me feel so sad: RT @username: @username: The future of games at retail http://t.co/rfSKaLsd


@username That's because Eskimo's don't have all that many words for snow. The Sami, however, do.


So this 3D marketing trend has really gone too far now. Why? 3D toothpaste...


RT "@username: I spent a week in Boston while my son was having a medical procedure done." Is he a Strogg now?


Well, this got a crapload of responses... http://t.co/MhDfGOrd


RT @username: "A guide on how to get more free space with Dropbox! http://t.co/4UHiMwUH Retweet for a chance to get +100GB!" Mmmm. Spaaace.


Screw you, Garshasp. After wrestling with clunky controls for 4 hours, your last savegame is 3 hours ago? *Installs Prince of Persia*


Yup. We're living in the future. Invisibility http://t.co/F9FCLGw9 holograms http://t.co/3AIUfSoN and 'free' energy http://t.co/Cb9sAqkR


Worst news I heard about my country in a looong time: http://t.co/N3EmwKF1 Stupid copyright hypocrits.


@username The DLC is sold as 'steampunk' and not as 'christmas' pack, so I see no reason for it to be temporary. Not 100% certain, though.


@username - took a couple of minutes to whip this up: http://t.co/2UMqOKcH PSD: http://t.co/NMiSDWSE


@username Are you sure you want to know that? http://t.co/LnkaYKAR

Made a background today. Warning: it's a bit bright. http://t.co/NveGEojy


@username Dont worry bro! I h4xx0r3d the website to work via this link: http://t.co/9GJyU0IO Good luck with your [nothing]! #confused


I think I should write more stuff. Articles, tutorials, plotlines...


Steam. For phones. What magic is this!? http://t.co/cRPviIFQ


Pineapple Smash Crew. Buy it. Play it. Enjoy it. http://t.co/BxY0F3am


@username We'll probably see some launch titles for the new xBox running UDK 4. I wouldn't be surprised if some corp's already have access.


@username So far: bad, because they're not used well but as a substitute for real goals & gameplay. Design games, not achievements.

damn adobe and their inconsistencies damn RIM for not having compliant sofware damn Unity for not running on Dalvik but on Mono

@username @username 1 more way games are less forgiving: if you suck, you can't play any further. (first 45 sec) http://t.co/1Gzch69t


@username Good luck trying to get some sleep the next couple of days. And the ones after those... and those...


Thank you, Google, for understanding what I mean when I'm too tired to type well. http://t.co/NrjcbQHD


@username Thought I'd let you know: your game reached Kotaku http://t.co/m3BQfmJF and me and some other commenters would like to know more.


Cheap gamers rejoice! http://t.co/5OUXq5cY is a Steam-like program that lists 300+ FREE games. (comparison: Steam has ~1575 games in total)


@username 5 years? Where was it at that time? The earliest I can think of is in Dr. Petter's Sculptris app. http://t.co/N4s9gySL


So... Spotify is working on an online radio service? But they can't even keep their normal servers up&running... #spotify #priorities


@username Today's the 4rth time in about a month that Spotify lost its connection. You guys really need to fix server stability.


I got a 9.3/10 in http://t.co/XMsMophT . Booyah! Bow before my color-controlling cortical cones.


Built a Crush the Castle level. Now I'm a real game designer, right? http://t.co/muFhF5sa


@username NBA2K13 and Need for Speed: The Run don't have 16-player online either; does that make them bad games?


@username I ordered one Friday but the store had no stock. Do I still get the $25 when they get stock? After all, I 'bought' yesterday.


"@username: @username http://t.co/kXtcUNYU turbosquid's reply to someone selling my IP on their marketplace" Goddamnit, Turbosquid... Sigh.


Dear Kotaku. I like you and all, but please learn the difference between parkour and freerunning. http://t.co/f96DfEBN


"How Portal 2 Developers Became The Best 6th Grade Physics Teachers Ever http://t.co/zA896C54 " Much better than Oregon Trail.


@username http://t.co/T4dEzsP0 is not one band. It's one band, and an unrelated hiphop project. They shouldn't be merged because of the name.


@username Do you mean Die Antwoord actually asked for it in a tweet or something, or just that they would work well as models?


Got a bit of extra work done on my sideproject, SomeHumans. Just some website mockups for now. Like? No like? http://t.co/bikeK1Dm

@username I just wanted to say that it's refreshing to see such big news (the chapter 11) delivered clearly and without PR lingo.


I beat the minimum and now own The Xmas Bundle 2.0 http://t.co/jLsNFiWj via @username


http://t.co/2DObRjLu Oooh... interesting stuff. A (linux based?) Steam console type thing.


Yay! My strip of silver finally arrived in the mail!


@username Just wanted to say thanks for the treasury of useful, interesting information you put out. A must-watch for every developer.


@username What happened guys, did the server crash? Or are you transferring to a new host or new software or something?


Playing Guitar Hero, soundcard crashes. Finished the set list anyway. =D


Xbox is going to be the new watercooler.. wait-what? Go home Xbox, you're drunk. http://t.co/jM1fy5VsJS


As of today I've got over 400 games on steam... and about 100 I've never played. Never gonna get rid of this backlog am I?


@username Hey I just saw you on KickStarter. I saw the game logo and immediately saw a cool ambigram possibility. http://t.co/ZFIy9RV77u


I never thought I'd be amazed by tearing/crumpling paper. https://t.co/EtZhfO17tE #siggraph #3d

Ooh, and game-sharing might be on Steam in the future... Nice! http://t.co/77YeVOfKT8


@username @username Stayed the same? No. Gone down. http://t.co/KkTX2FmL6I Because inflation. You should know that, Mr. Bachelor's.


@username @username If you play just the campaign, you're not buying all the DLC maps packs, are you?


@username Which means that if the price stays the same ($50 back then, $50 now), with less value per dollar, games are lower value/cheaper.


@username We want games to be BETTER. If we go for cheap as the primary factor, we end up with clones, free-to-pay and social-exploitation.

Just installed the new #Opera browser version. Dear god. ó_ò All the features are gone. It's like going from Word to Notepad. T_T


Just bought the Huawei P1 via @username. Really great deal at €204,34 (shipping included).


This is a pretty interesting game based entirely on talking: http://t.co/GTHmkweVqO


I wanna have a game out and playable by Januari. There. I've said it. It's out in the world now.


@username Thanks for the @username article, having positive examples of games is great. Are you aware of @username's "Games for Good"?


@username @username Uncooperative and/or slacking students make for a bad learning environment.


Just bought two music CDs this week (Machinæ Supremacy and Mustasch, if you must know). That's the first time in, what, 5 years?


@username A poly is several things. :P

Just -almost- lost my entire site when trying to change folder organization. Thank you, universe, for hinting I should back-up more often!


Thinking about consoles in 2017. With Sony's PS4 dev tools launch games will look better, but we'll see less improvement over the lifecycle?


@username Well. This is dumb. If you make a bad game, suck up the criticism and make better ones. http://t.co/AB6crKmzeD via @username


@username Not wasted time though. More like a PSA. It's good that you show us the worms in the can at times.


So far (just been using it for a month) I like @username a lot, but I don't really agree with their new pricing schemes. Mhmm...


Shit interface design: parking ticket pole sells daytickets for 3.50, or hoy rates of 1.20, I put in 3.50 and press buy. It gives 2hr55m.


Cutest Deadpool cosplay? http://t.co/Xrz9qOg6Lb


Wow. Dyscourse (http://t.co/eZkSPgNA5d) sounds similar to something I'm making. Down to "Oregon Trail" and "Walking Dead" as inspirations.


@username Might wanna look into this; Hotmail says the newsletter is shifty, I reckon many people didn't receive it. http://t.co/MWECGRPoTR


@username ...this is actually one of the most convincing arguments for the xbox, assuming it lives up to what you're advertising here.
