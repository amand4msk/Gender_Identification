My body feels taut I'm wound so tight. Think ill smoke a bowl and relax some before I try and crawl into bed.


Aches and pains and pains and aches.


That's the end of that.


Charm her


Leg and joint pains that even a bowl can't shake.


Watching #takesfromthecrypt ???????? #bordelloofblood


Cause deep down you know that it's Edgar Frog of the Frog brothers #catchthatreference


Letting my hair dye sit. This part always takes forever.


2 chainz in this episode of #svu?? Epic!


I think it's about time to grow up and start trying to put some effort into life again.


Love when I get stoned enough to style my hair <3


I can't tell what you're thinking.


Smiling cause this song will always be one of ours.


Playing Soul Calibur 4 with the guys! :) #ps3


Bowls and video games with my guy and his best friend #greatafternoon #summertime #soulcalibur4 #ps3


I'm not ready to be broken again.


I don't know what to do right now.....


I'm eating my head


3-4 hours of work left and I just want to c up and pretend the world doesn't exist.


I'm honestly just barely holding on right now.


Hoping for the best, expecting the worst #always


Seen on fence "beauty will save the world" "Pft, fuck that."

I'm watching #TheWarriorsWay on #GetGlue http://t.co/VYiFmAmjD9


Had it since it came out, but I'm finally sitting down and playing #thelastofus!!! #ps3


Put on pants to make breakfast? What for?


Left me a hit ????


Watching #blacksnakemoan before I hop along to work. One of my favorites!!


Fuck me, this soundtrack is godly ?????


At work a half hour early ????


I'll dream that you mean me, even though I know that time is already past and gone


You still cross my mind so much


Soo hungry. I feel like that's becoming the status quo


I'm watching #Zulu on #GetGlue http://t.co/AGqzAjMHSb


I wish they'd stop fucking up the schedule over at the cinemas


Burn it slow to maximize the smoke


I'm watching #ButterflySword on #GetGlue http://t.co/7RKbwB1x1v


Wish I had another hit left.


Headed to work early for some extra hours #moneyhungry


Making the first bus>>>


Cleaning around the house.


Having a Snow White moment.


It feels like you rarely pick up when I call lately...


I know what you say you're up to, but lets face facts; I'm still wondering.


I'm running on 3 hours of sleep and been kicking ass all day; my last theater doesn't get out till 2:11am and I've got a bikeride home still


Stealing a break, cause I'm beat #exhausted #worktweet #allaboutthebenjamins


I won't lie. I wish you'd text me more...


To my coworker who barricaded me in the supply closet while I was getting restock.... You're ducking hilarious, James #worktweet


I dunno if it's more irritating that I have 2 theaters left or that I have to wait 20 minutes before I can hit the next one #worktweet


@username yeah I really enjoy the job, just not enjoying the movie schedule right now lol


Annnddd waiting on my final theater -.- #planaheadbetter #tipsformanagment #latenight #worktweet


First time getting stuck at the train tracks on my ride home #biketweet


It's hard to admit, I trust you less and less all the time.


Probably have no reason to be, but I have to admit, I'm more than a little hurt.


Contemplations of kindness that will kill you.


Fuck this day, I'm ready for the next one.


#nowwatching #GhostAdventures instead


Wiping down, washing up, baking. The usual. #productivestoner


I guess the truth is that I'm not expecting much from you at this point.


I should not have to pick up your slack if I'm getting paid less than you #worktweet


Not that I mind the ride home...


Damn, had no idea how late/early it is. Guess I got lost playing #tombraider #ps3 #gamergirl


Utterly ambivalent.


Bout to take a rip and fold some laundry. Time to get shit done.


On some other level right now


Coconut cookies, mango Mochi ice cream, and pork bones for the dogs. Fuck yeah.


Bout to get dressed, rip the rest if this bowl and hit up target real quick so I can get on these pies.


@username lol!!! Key Lime and strawberry. I'm practicing for a pie contest that's coming up on the 14th :)


Recently I've made: coconut cream, coconut custard, strawberry, blueberry, strawberry-blueberry honey, and a pecan pie.


Next up: Key Lime pie and another Strawberry pie.


Made a "southwestern" style lasgna last night, Tex Mex Italian came out pretty fucken proper. #stonerfood #nomz #munchies


Wish this ps3 update wasn't taking so long -.-


Flying so fucken low tonight.


Bus driver is super impressed with how I handle the bike rack like nothing #fitliving ????


Despite that it's completely possible, I can't believe that my laundry is done drying already.


Guilty pleasure? Watching #JerseyShore #cantlie


Got switched from day to night shift. Sweet ????


Home before I was even scheduled to be off #fuckyeah


Rode like the fucken wind #bikelife


Woooow to guys at work who just don't take the hint ????


Hello July.


I hateeee being cold


Terrified to trust.


Wish I could remember where I put my nail polish -.-


Painting my nails. Still trying to decide how to do them for 4th of July though ????


Morning Romp. Cyrus enjoying his backyard ???????? #mornings #pitbull #rednose http://t.co/Zs7AVbTl0Y


My dog is really just holding a stick in his mouth and running laps around our back yard. How can I bottle and sell this?!?!


Fml. Missed my first bus so now I'm gonna be 20 minutes late to work, unless someone who can give me a ride wakes up.


Caught "World War Z" this morning, was pretty interesting. Leaving in a bit for "This Is The End" #cinemalife
