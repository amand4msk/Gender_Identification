@username Coincidentally, a recent French piece places Busa's work in its historical context : http://t.co/MV1lbI1 #digitalhumanities


@username @username the chair we have just lost seemed to be going in the right direction in that respect #teiputsch


@username @username keeping the community informed is not seemingly a priority for the plotters #teiputsch


@username @username believe me the only sane voting member present also feels blindsided #teiputsch


@username at board telecon on 12th I moved a vote of confidence in the chair which was defeated 3:1 #teiputsch


@username @username officially there is no vice chair. dan has argued that it should be susan, it's not clear she agrees #teiputsch


@username much of what it says on that web page has been invalidated by structural changes introduced last year #teiputsch


@username @username My mistake... the meeting was actually on the 11th, thursday. If that matters. #teiputsch


@username Result! btw... board is currently trying to agree wording of official statement


@username by their fruits shall ye know them


@username What exactly amazed you? That it should be mentioned at all, or that it should be mentioned positively? Just wondering.


The motivation claimed by those who engineered the #teiputsch does not reference the chair's vision document.


@username which is why @username is such a way cool project!


@username I would love to, but the current Board insists its email is private. I have asked for a public statement twice now #teiputsch


@username @username what are you two up to?


@username @username @username ostensible reason for voting against martin was nothing to do with his vision doc #teiputsch


Sorry just back from dentist so going offline for a while...


@username and the winner is...?


@username Sfaics, only THREE uk he institutions have registered for BOB so far. This seems a shame. Or am I looking in wrong place?


@username so how do you feel about the ubuntu "boing-swissh" ?


@username What a nice way to spend the day. I will check this evening to see how you got on!


@username wanna try that again without the typo #teiputsch ?


Useful bibliog on digital forensics http://t.co/ouGAtKu #forensics


@username @username @username tsk tsk, are you saying that art is not real?


@username @username both are correct, but the former is more formal


@username I hope not! Though of course, P6 will be along some day... board or no board


@username All those words and citations and not one measly picture?


RT @username A slight rant about poorly planned websites that also manages to bandwagon on the recent riots: http://t.co/FcI9D33


Here's one for David Starkie http://t.co/R7Ddh6x (tx Florian Willan) I don't like your tweet sir: we'll teach you the professors way


Hugh Cayless has some useful comments on #teifuture on his Googleplus but I dunno how to link to them from here. Anyone?


@username @username tx! cut and paste the URL! how obvious... and yet how quaint! (happy birthday bethanie: u shd go back to bed)


@username @username @username More space for thoughtful commentary than here or FB tho


@username I misheard prof elemental as saying "i dont like your tweet sir" first time round... lovin it.


@username how's the move going?


@username good move! come across professor elemental yet? http://t.co/l3WUyY7


@username oops, i meant of course http://t.co/Dw2uKqm


@username the usual way, i expect. what are you on about?


@username @username @username I doubt Julia meant 2imply that: maybe she felt issues were being trivialised on twitter #teifuture


@username @username @username Oh you mean trolling! It all depends on Julia's opnion of reality tv : maybe s'one shd ask her!


@username @username @username hm yes, rereading that msg it does sound like patronising exclusionist guff .. not good


@username @username @username comms failure partly due to prev board policy of keeping all discussion confidential grr #teifuture


@username getting a bit sickly now though surely?


http://t.co/m7DCv7e all v interesting; extent of semantic overlap between TEI core elements and HTML5 tags remains to be seen #teifuture


#dayofdh seems to have fallen over... victim of its own success, clearly


@username not visibly on the dt website tho chiz chiz


Was going to spend all day uploading photos to my day-of-dh blog, but since it's bust, has spent all day on http://bit.ly/bNDnqE instead

"Nothing in digital form is ever finished" (it has said so on my home page since c. 1997) #uvashape


@username I just have this ideological problem about paying to download things. Must get over it.


@username -- is that what we used to call an argument?


@username all funding schemes are fragile to a greater or lesser extent


RT @username: Folksonomies et hypomnemata numériques http://bit.ly/9ChOdm some useful thoughts on tweeting (in french) #uvashape


@username Almost certainly yes if the bizness model works


@username And so it does, provided you got to it on a bike


@username wouldnt it be more interesting to know what proportion of the historians are DH faculty? #uvashape


@username acc to Y Wilks, noone bothered to tell Bill that IWS was coming to OII


@username : are hrionline texts in TEI?


hm, I think Ian L: is only nearly right: Humanities is traditionally the *reinterpreter* of great ideas, not their custodian #uvashape


@username so you've given up on nexus already ?


I love the way the boundaries of this term "humanities" are shifting as rapidly as those of "sustainmibility" were yesterday #uvashape


@username @username skim-reading yr talk reminds me to suggest DH projects wch dont expose their TEI sources shd be strangled at birth

conjecturator seems close to corpus linguistics and closer to authorship studies i.e. main stream old skool LLC #uvashape


@username @username @username I'm even older than him and i probably agree too #uvashape


edited twitterings around #uvashape will be an interesting spectacle... complete with glosses, annotation, we hope

Here's a really neat way of detecting dodgy stats: tx @username http://t.co/g8CZCacH


vanhoutte at #dhhh seems to believe there are ontological distinctions amonst disciplines which are independent of socially constructed ones


@username my hypothesis is that the term "humanities computing" was closely associated (by B'well) with OUP at that time ... #dhhh


Interesting to see which HC foundational texts edward selectes/ overlooks ... #dhhh


oh dear: evh thinks terms exist independently of their use #dhhh
