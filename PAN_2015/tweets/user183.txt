@username hipster! :-)


@username sorry to disappoint you, LREC is a two-yearly conference #LREC2014


Is there an #LREC2014 participant list?


Where do we apply for other conference funding? “@username: #LREC2014 : EC will support our community... more euros ?”


Did not notice any of the promised brevity in ELRA talk. We need coffee! #LREC2014 #coffeebreakplease #overtime


#LREC2014 tip: there's a larger coffee area downstairs


Empty room 15 minutes before keynote speech #LREC2014


2 min and 12 slides to go #o20 #LREC2014 http://t.co/EgHiPZcSZl


Like the #LREC2014 moodmap but suggest putting general tag in a separate table for more detail for the others http://t.co/6UdcCoipF7


@username Great update ! Thanks for responding


@username nice talk! I’ll try to come and talk to you later


Is @username still at #LREC2014 ? Would like to say hello


How disappointing that this isn't for us #LREC2014 http://t.co/HkdO7VGTPM


Just presented CSI corpus for stylometry, author profiling, sentiment & deception detection #o29 #LREC2014 http://t.co/37prsNAi5B Enjoy!


Some commercial sentiment analysers under baseline for some corpora. Ouch! #o29 #LREC2014 http://t.co/4q7hBfq1TE


Microphone people should be instructed to run to people with questions. They're álways late strolling over there! #LREC2014


I'm guessing the co-authors did not proofread these slides #lrec2014 #yesno http://t.co/oCnoqOWCZ0

@username @username @username i see only 3 tweets with lrec and o1 hashtags. Seems like sth went wrong, lots of irrelevant tweets w only #o1


Really liked #LREC2014, though the lack of twitter interaction saddened me.


@username there was quite some action, but interaction less so imo


@username exactly what I meant, but I’ve experienced #ICWSM13 which raises expectations :-)


@username hey June, don't make it bad. Take a sad song and make it better #nananananana


@username Only if there's an international airport


@username going to #tedxghent tomorrow? I'd come and say hello :-)


@username So, where are you headed?


@username Are you changing jobs as well? Thought you had a postdoc?


Great to meet @username at #TEDxGhent today. Until we meet again, my friend! http://t.co/H7rCKzL6YK


@username Life’s great, thanks! TedxGhent was worth attending. Saw some really cool talks, want to share this video https://t.co/v7TNOUzjwR


@username i've registered for @username 's klout party in Antwerp in july. Maybe there?


This is my 1111th tweet. Glad I did something useful with it.


Looking forward to an interesting #DHBenelux conference! Now up: keynote by @username


http://t.co/Dkh4LpgLnq -> cool crowdsourced map (and routeplanner!) of Roman Empire by @username at #dhbenelux


Imagine a virtual choir by crowdsourcing of youtube videos #DHBenelux http://t.co/ZnhVWMcHQK


Virtual art by #crowdsourcing see Eric Whitacre, eg http://t.co/jErBDh1lDm #dhbenelux


Some really great research on music being presented at the #DHBenelux poster session


@username only if we consider both to be a cultural issue where women are less technologically inclined #dhbenelux


@username @username @username Will do! Great suggestions, @username. Thanks!


@username Thanks! Glad you enjoyed it :-)


@username Haha, no worries. Walter (my supervisor) will be delighted to hear that people find him to be looking so young ;-)


@username Pics or it didn't happen


Oh my god. No Facebook! #thehorrorthehorror


@username Maybe check if the air starts drooling if you ring a bell, then it's already conditioned

@username @username Africa is not a country


@username @username @username I smell a secret friend-making tactic :-D


Courtois was man of the match! #korbel #zkobel @username


I'm cheering for @username. Though I'm already Belgian, I Belgiumized my name to Boudewijn Van den Broeck at belgiumizeme.be #worldcup


@username Because of course


@username didn't you do that the week before #dh2015 ?


@username Say hi to my South African friend Wikus Pienaar at @username for me, will you? :-)

@username @username You heard them, Merisa. You have to meet :-D By the way, Have fun!

How to encourage girls to choose IT or learn programming https://t.co/I0GFEnfQ45 Congrats to @username and Jane!


@username It's actually the opposite of the fightclub rules: 1) You DO talk about the conference 2) You DO talk about the conference


@username And will the programme be available before that deadline? Would be handy


@username Thanks for concern. Terrible news indeed, but no personal losses.


@username Great! Looking forward to it !


@username I don't get it. Why don't you like the name of this Dutch café/restaurant?


@username Probably selection is so strict that you're not in as soon as there is doubt


@username Dutch: "Hallo, Wereld"


@username ben er! #team610 for the win :-D


@username @username @username and far more clean and safe, says every sane person :-)


@username i think you should come to the office more often! :-) when is that cellar ready btw? :-D


@username quick question: can I save a #pattern datasheet without the quotation marks around every value?


@username wanted to make the file uniform w others, no worries, have decided to leave it be ;-)


@username also really looking forward to it!


Right now, my Kardashian-index is 9.1 (182/20). Scientists, check yours! (twitter followers / citations) http://t.co/hUqAGmJIRA


@username Or, people will have to start citing me more. :-) No, I think the K-index can only be used for postdocs and professors.


@username @username The best time to actually make the booking, or the best time for which you should book?


@username Oh :-( I only read the @username article, not the paper


@username Not sure whether the amount of interaction in DH is always reflected in nr of followers.


@username How can one request support for an academic event from Elsevier? (linguistics)


@username How can one request support for an academic event from John Benjamins? (linguistics)


@username Trying to contact #Nuance marketing office for academic event sponsorship (comput. linguistics) can you refer me? Thanks!


@username oh, dat was retorisch, sorry #LT
