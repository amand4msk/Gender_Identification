I'm sorry but after reading that, Ched seemed to have an intention to go into that hotel room, he lied about his reasons for needing a key


But ultimately, the question is should consent given when intoxicated be seen as being reliable?


“@username: Accountability is important anyway, we will never know if Ched is really guilty or not”<


Very important to note, the receptionist stated "some footballers" booked the hotel room. The stigma attached to being a public figure..


.. May have been the deciding factor for Ched. As far as the law is concerned he should know better.


But is that fair? Shouldn't we hold every single person to the same level of expectation?


Public figure or not, when it comes to the law, right or wrong there shouldn't be a greater desire to punish 1 over the other


A man's livelihood is in jeopardy now because his job is to score goals and entertain


“@username: OFFICIAL: Burnley and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the permanent transfer for M.Keane for £2m. #MUFC”<
