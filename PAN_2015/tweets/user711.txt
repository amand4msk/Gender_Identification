@username does Heroes of the Storm count?


#E3 + following some game people = one bajillion tweets per second.


@username bringing new meaning to the term "board member"


@username @username Because wool things are more volumetric, and flat/spiky things like leaves/teeth (and road) look better as felt.


@username Cause you're uninformed? Sudan, Uganda, Cambodia. (genocides) Yang Xinhai, Ramadan Mansour, Luis Garavito. (mass murderers)


@username Doesn't matter much. Plenty of them support it. Current 'alpha males' didn't start patriarchy either.


@username @username @username It's not about the money. It's about promising 1 video a month and only delivering 4 vids in 2 years.


No, PC Advisor. Inkjet printers do NOT fall under the category of color laser printers... http://t.co/qt1Apjcd76


And no, @username. Anything that has a sticker saying "Xerox" is not an HP Officejet. Nor is the 8100 a laser printer. http://t.co/cYSFi4GEns


@username I'm really saddened that you have macro photos of tablet screens, test photos on phones, but no sample scans for printers.


@username He has a tiny point but misses the parts where reviews drive purchases, and where letsplays are transformative in nature.


I really quite like it that Red Bull will just up and fund stuff like Danny MacAskill's Imaginate: http://t.co/Njw81iVzjy via @username


@username @username Availability of old/obscure/quirky/bad games is not a bad thing. The prominence and promotion of those games is.


It sucks when your phone suddenly won't read a simcard any more. It sucks even more when your PC breaks while looking for a solution. =(


@username Hurray for Dutch sportsball, huh?


@username I was on @username and noticed all the 3d models work just fine on my Nexus 7. *thumbs up* for crossplatform functionality!


The current @username bundle is worth it just for @username 's fantastic Pineapple Smash Crew.


Today, fear soaked fabric as over 50 victims suffered a gruesome fate. My wardrobe shrunk from 100cm to only 57cm. (1/3)


Among the casualties are 6 tops, 18 tees, 10 longsleeves, 8 dress shirts, 5 pants, 6 shorts and a suit. (2/3)


Just saw fireworks in the #netherlands , wondering if it's for #fifaworldcup #BRAvsCOL or some U.S. expats celebrating #IndependenceDay


@username Man, what a waste of a tweet, talking about responses you don't like... You could have spent it on making a "WTF is?" video ;)


@username But today is not that day!! http://t.co/V0y7Dpp3XM


@username because its spelled "Götze" and 'oe' is the internationally accepted spelling when you don't have access to diacritics.


@username is this in response to the recent gamasutra article / FTC quote?


Bought a new PC with Windows 8.1 hoping it wouldn't be so bad now with the updates. After a day I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown... =(


Seriously. Who had the idea to replace the standard calculator by a full screen app? I don't need 1920x1200 to multiply some numbers.


@username @username Instead you want these. Chocolate/marzipan/sugarsprinkles. Don't know the English name. http://t.co/znQjgxeIav


@username Yeah I've been looking into similar things, like the stuff from @username. Not sure what I end up choosing yet.


@username Also, W8.1 apparently has regular calc, but also an appified version (as default) for added confusion and frustration.*sigh*


@username Definitely gonna give it a try. Seems to be the most feature rich one, and I love the price of free.


@username Right now? I don't really know. There's no way to disable the metro bit (outside of 3rd party (cont) http://t.co/7zMcs94hQM


@username Pix or it didn't happen. (Or linx)


@username Maybe they're taking the adage "all publicity is good publicity" a tad too literal?


@username @username Heh. I like how they call Forbes 'unprofessional'. It's only a century old business magazine, after all.


Well, #Dota2TI4 championship final was a bit of a letdown... Very one-sided, almost like the Brazil #FIFA2014 matches earlier this month.


@username How come NL/EU prices for businesses are so skewed? I almost understand $140 -> €140 But there's no way $400 should -> €540($727)


Statistics! Colors! Games! Graphs! Numbers! Info! Money! Jerbs! Exclamation Marks! http://t.co/hveVXSCr9V #gamedev


@username Ooh. Freddie Mercury! I loved his music in Neverending Story as well. But why is that Spiderman quote in there?


@username Your bundle currently costs. ?€ I thought that was funny.


@username Remember when you mentioned RU-UA-EU war? It's already happening on kickstarter, according to Areal! http://t.co/Tqbsyc9eSC


This is a good looking kickstarter! https://t.co/9EmXuUuNd2 Love the vid and the header gifs. (oh and the game itself looks interesting too)


I wouldn't hurt the proverbial fly, but those damn mosquitos... Just killed at least two dozen of the bitey fuckers.


@username With you being you, I'm not sure if that's ASAP or never.


How come art software always has such a shitty GUI? I'd assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability.


@username Will this work with the regular PC forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? Would be handy to have that integrated.


@username Gotta be honest here, these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. A downside of 3d, or maybe a render/filter issue?


@username Can hardly wait for PC version X. What I've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work.


@username Yeah I know they're 2x. I scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. Does ingame have normals or something?


@username I just finished my last game for the day, this should be a nice way to unwind.


@username @username It really depends on the quality of the stuff, much like chocolate. Often I find they add too much powder, too.


I... Uh... what? Dafuq? https://t.co/VT0eMJofYN


@username Don't worry. You will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals. http://t.co/c8qaZNjW3L


@username How are the podcasts rubbish? Only thing edited for (the YT version of) that are the commercials, right?


@username I get the removal of streamed 'regular' music, I do. But background music from games? And beyond that, do you think that (1/2)


@username it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=©, too) You generally say that streaming is a transformative art.


@username Technically, this is a mobile game. And I'm not sure I would call this 'playing'.


Yup, salticidae are definitely the bestest, coolest and most awesomest spiders. https://t.co/Wr1elzCRf4


@username No. You'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables, when such a simple command is all you need.


@username Ooh. Sanchez. I strongly approve of this.


@username @username @username I'm in that camp. Everyone* has a smartphone now, which makes it a true -personal- computer.


@username @username The biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. Sports thrive on spectators. (semi)Finals get more views.


@username @username Says it right there "? The Jester Race A song by In Flames"


@username @username Given that you regularly do long takes, though, this one felt "slighly off". (j/k well done Zooc)


@username Lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy.


@username I think you're mixing up Gone Home and Dear Esther. Not many people argued Gone Home wasn't a game, just not a GOOD one.


@username I think you should do a combination. Good projects deserve love, but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned.


@username It might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? Nope, nope, nope, this looks decent.


@username @username @username Hurrah! You didn't call it the A/S/L challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name.


@username @username Heck, look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box...


@username AND DOLLA DOLLA BILLS YO. (also my shirt)


@username @username http://t.co/LrtfFdiNqJ seems kind of relevant in this case too. From several perspectives.


@username You're right on the first account. Many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of debates is divisive. http://t.co/E4kkt588dH


@username What's the crest for that?


@username That actually seems interesting data, yeah. I wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that.


Using your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving. Sorry mr snail...


@username Liking youtubers isn't a problem either. Which leaves "harassing" as the only issue.


@username Threat? Or... treat?


Simple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. Good on you, Germany. http://t.co/W62Wy4yIyr


@username I know, right. You're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time.


@username For me, personally, it's like a TV show. I can relax to it because it's more passive than articles, yet is not supershort.


@username @username Quite an innovative new 'exclusive' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.Wonder where this will go?


@username @username You mean "asshole" culture, within the gaming and internet audience, right? I'm pretty sure that's what you mean.


@username @username @username Should the flooding work that way? Don't you need 2 holes; one for water in, one for air out?


@username Dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness.


@username Jim, try Monster Rehab. It's not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn't taste like deat-... I mean sweeteners.


@username @username Unless your licence gets voided, in which case you pay €35 AND €70. Personally, I just wait for price drops.


@username @username And what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play?


@username @username It was a hypothetical. Hence why he says "at your own risk". It might work fine, it might cost you.


@username Definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. A game has max 20 minutes, if it impresses you sooner, good on it.


@username @username Ooh, this is pretty. Any info on how it's done? Looks like uprezzed render, sure, but any special texture approach?


@username What, you're able to not hate someone you disagree with? Is this some kind of magic? Are you a wizerds?


@username @username It is rather uncanny... http://t.co/EzJMUWrtS0


Just binge-read the entirety of @username's comic. It's gooood. http://t.co/jVOCCOc5fp


@username @username With 300+ employees, they're well past the 'Dunbar number'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage.


Didn't know I, a European, could send emails about net neutrality to US Gov. EUROPEANS UNITE! http://t.co/iJssKlF3rJ http://t.co/11MWt6BLo7


@username I've always likened Dear Esther to a book or movie. You can press play/pause, but you don't really have any agency.


@username Personally, I'd love physical media as an option, if it were JUST that. But most games nowadays are just a DVD + steam code.


@username Next bundle? http://t.co/OJ7iOFedwb


@username you have your own NPC and you're giving out games? CONSPIRACYYY!!!!


@username @username @username He's an author at Destructoid. He IS games media. Conrad, thanks for making the distinction.
